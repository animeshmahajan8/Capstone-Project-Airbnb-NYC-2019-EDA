## Approach

Here are the key steps for conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) for Airbnb Bookings analysis:
1.	Data acquisition: Obtain a representative sample of the data from the airbnb company, including customer demographic information, review patterns, and availability etc.
2.	Data cleaning: Remove any missing or incomplete data, and ensure that the data is in a format that can be easily analyzed.
3.	Data visualization: Use plots and charts to visualize the data and identify trends and patterns. For example, you might create histograms to understand the distribution of various continous data like price, number of reviews, or scatter plots to identify correlations between different variables.
4.	Data summarization: Use statistical techniques to summarize the data and understand the relationships between different variables. For example, you might calculate means, medians, and standard deviations to understand the distribution of continous data like price and number of reviews.
Overall, the goal of EDA for airbnb booking analysis is to maximize occupancy rates, profitability, and guest satisfaction in the client's Airbnb rental business in New York City.
